# FlashCards Project

This project uses a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. The project breaks up objects into individual class files to demonstrate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) using TDD to drive the implementation of code.
  
## Learning Goals
  - Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
  - Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
  - Implement ES6 classes
  - Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
  - Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
  
## Technologies Used
  - JavaScript
  
## Setup
  - Clone this repository
  - Run ```npm install``` in your terminal command line
  - Run ```node index.js``` in your terminal command line to start the game
